Nanotechnologies are greatly interested in FAIR data management and dedicated ontologies, since developing materials and devices, understanding new materials and supporting applications in health,
environment and other key and challenging areas require long times, huge resources, both infrastructure and materials and energy, and skilled staff, which are probably today the most rare resources.
In the field of nanotechnologies, the research areas of materials/nanomaterials development, (including modelling and simulations), and materials characterization are experiencing well- developed studies
aimed at establishing structured methodologies for describing and archiving experiments. We cite Characterization Data (ChaDa) dedicated to data management of material characteriza(on
experiments, and Modelling Data (MoDa), which keep evolving and are for sure important references for both ontology and FAIR data management in the mentioned fields.
In this paper, we introduce Nanofabrication Data (NaDa) Taxonomy, a shared vocabulary tailored specifically for the nanofabrication ecosystem. We have started working on FAIR data management for a
speific research area part of nanotechnologies: the nanofabricatuon. By aligning with the FAIR Data Principles, NaDa Taxonomy sets out to unify descriptive and procedural terms, creating a consistent
foundation for data documentation and management across different labs, instruments, and projects.

The goal is to allow researchers not only to locate and retrieve valuable datasets readily, but also to interpret and integrate them seamlessly into new or ongoing experiments. As nanofabrication
accelerates toward increasingly intricate devices and processes, adopting a standardized taxonomy is essential for collaborative research, knowledge transfer, and, ultimately, the development of nextgenera
tion technologies
