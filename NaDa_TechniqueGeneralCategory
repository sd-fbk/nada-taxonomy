ADD: nanofabrication process class including elementary nanofabrication processes determining the integration of a layer of material on the surface of the item undergoing the fabrication using chemical or physical effects. This category incluedes nanofabrication techniques which add materials, generally thin films, on the top of the item, generally a wafer. The added materials can be part of the final device or have a temporary role in the fabrication, to be removed before the end of the fabrication itself.
REMOVE nanofabrication process class including elementary nanofabrication processes determining the removal of material from the surface of the item or directly part of the item undergoing the fabrication usign chemical or physical effects
TRANSFORM: nanofabrication process class including elementary nanofabrication processes determining a chemical or physical change in the item or in the material layers present on the surface of the item
CHARACTERIZE: measurement technologies already defined in the ChaDa taxonomy and Chameo ontology
